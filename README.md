# Introduction

-  Manually marking attendance consumes a lot of time. 
-  In a class of 50 minutes, it takes around 10 minutes just to mark attendance of 60 students, which wastes 400+ hours every week, which could be better utilized in teaching. 
-  We aim to simplify the procedure by marking the attendance automatically for every student. 
-  Our application eases the attendance marking system and reduces redundant attendance time in a lecture.
